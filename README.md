Vahe Andonians' Randomly Created Dataset for Linear Regression - Kaggle Dataset

To note that this repo is released under the MIT Licence in respect of the data analysis and learning over and above the original dataset, but original credit and IP remains with its originator: https://www.kaggle.com/andonians/random-linear-regression/data

## Task

* Linear regression is used to predict the value of an outcome variable Y 
* based on one or more input predictor variables X.
* The aim is to establish a linear relationship (a mathematical formula) 
* between the predictor variable(s) and the response variable, so that, we can use this formula to estimate the value of the response Y, when only the predictors (Xs) values are known.

# Readme and Instructions from originator on Kaggle As Follows:

### Context

This is probably the dumbest dataset on Kaggle. The whole point is, however, to provide a common dataset for linear regression. Although such a dataset can easily be generated in Excel with random numbers, results would not be comparable.

### Content

The training dataset is a CSV file with 700 data pairs (x,y). The x-values are numbers between 0 and 100. The corresponding y-values have been generated using the Excel function NORMINV(RAND(), x, 3). Consequently, the best estimate for y should be x. The test dataset is a CSV file with 300 data pairs.

### Acknowledgements

Thank you, Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston for inventing the first spreadsheet.

### Inspiration

I hope this dataset will encourage all newbies to enter the world of machine learning, possibly starting with a simple linear regression.

### Data license

Obviously, data is free.
